When we have a list of things to loop through, we can construct a definite loop using a `for` statement. We call the `while` statement an *indefinite* loop because it simply loops until some condition becomes `False`, whereas the for loop is looping through a known set of items so it runs through as many iterations as there are items in the set.\n",
