# Ways to View and Edit Jupyter Notebooks

There are two methods to easily view and edit Jupyter notebooks:

## Method 1: Use GitHub Dev

If the notebook is hosted on GitHub, you can quickly open it in VSCode's web version. For example, if the notebook is located at this URL: https://github.com/AU-AIST-2110-Spring25-SectionA/Code-Scripts/blob/main/Week_02.ipynb, 

you can simply change `github.com` to `github.dev`, like this: https://github.dev/AU-AIST-2110-Spring25-SectionA/Code-Scripts/blob/main/Week_02.ipynb

This will load the notebook in VSCode Web. To enable Jupyter capabilities, you'll need to connect VSCode to a Codespace. 

## Method 2: Using Google Colab with GitHub

Google Colab can directly load public GitHub notebooks without requiring any authorization.

For example, consider this notebook: [https://github.com/googlecolab/colabtools/blob/master/notebooks/colab-github-demo.ipynb](https://github.com/googlecolab/colabtools/blob/master/notebooks/colab-github-demo.ipynb).

You can open it directly in Colab using this link: [https://colab.research.google.com/github/googlecolab/colabtools/blob/master/notebooks/colab-github-demo.ipynb](https://colab.research.google.com/github/googlecolab/colabtools/blob/master/notebooks/colab-github-demo.ipynb).

To create such links with one click, you can use the [Open in Colab](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/open-in-colab/iogfkhleblhcpcekbiedikdehleodpjo) Chrome extension.

For more information, you can check out the [Colab GitHub Demo Notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/github/googlecolab/colabtools/blob/master/notebooks/colab-github-demo.ipynb).
